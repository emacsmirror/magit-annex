Magit-annex NEWS -- history of user-visible changes   -*- mode: org; -*-

* master (unreleased)

Magit-annex has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 4.0.0 or later.

* 1.8.0

Magit-annex has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 3.0.0 or later.

** Interface changes

- To be compatible with the latest Magit, popups have been rewritten
  as transient commands.

  A few key bindings for options now start with ~-~ rather than ~=~
  because, unlike magit-popup.el, transient.el doesn't require that
  options start with ~=~.  You can restore the previous bindings with

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (transient-suffix-put 'magit-annex-sync "-j" :key "=j")
  (transient-suffix-put 'magit-annex-file-action "-j" :key "=j")
  (transient-suffix-put 'magit-annex-file-action "-n" :key "=n")
  (transient-suffix-put 'magit-annex-unused "-r" :key "=r")
  #+end_src

- ~magit-annex-unused-log~ now immediately displays the log instead of
  opening the log popup and is bound to ~C-c C-l~ in
  ~magit-annex-unused-mode-map~ rather than shadowing the default
  binding of ~magit-log~.

* 1.7.0

Magit-annex has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 2.90.0 or later.

* 1.6.0

** New features

- File action commands now support Dired buffers.  The file at point
  (or marked files) is used as the default for completion.

  Consider binding ~magit-annex-file-action-popup~ to a key in Dired
  buffers.  If you are using git-annex.el, you can bind the popup to
  ~@f~ like this:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key git-annex-dired-map "f" #'magit-annex-file-action-popup)
  #+end_src

- In ~magit-annex-list-mode~ buffers, file action commands now
  consider files selected by the region when choosing a default for
  completion.

- ~git annex undo~ is now exposed via ~magit-annex-undo-files~, a new
  command available in ~magit-annex-file-action-popup~.

** Interface changes

- ~magit-annex-list-popup~ now invokes the popup rather than the
  default action when called without a prefix.

  You can restore the previous behavior with

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq magit-annex-list-popup
        (plist-put magit-annex-list-popup :use-prefix 'popup))
  #+end_src

* 1.5.0

Magit-annex has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 2.12.0 or later.

* 1.4.0

Magit-annex has been updated for the latest version of Magit and now
requires version 2.11.0 or later.

** Interface changes

- Starting with Magit 2.11.0, the commands ~magit-git-command~ and
  ~magit-git-command-topdir~ add "git " to the initial input rather
  than prepending it to the input after it is read.  This change
  enables arbitrary shell commands to be executed.  Similarly, the
  commands ~magit-annex-command~ and ~magit-annex-command-topdir~ now
  set the initial input to "git annex ".

** Miscellaneous

- The option ~magit-annex-standard-options~ has been renamed to
  ~magit-annex-global-arguments~ and marked as obsolete.

* 1.3.1

** New features

- The ~--no-commit~ switch and ~--jobs~ option have been added to
  ~magit-annex-sync-popup~.

* 1.3.0

** New features

- The prompt for file actions now supports wildcards.

- The command ~magit-annex-unused~ now supports arguments through the
  new popup ~magit-annex-unused-popup~.  A new command
  ~magit-annex-unused-reflog~ has also been added to the popup.
  ~magit-annex-unused-popup~ has replaced ~magit-annex-unused-popup~
  in the top-level Magit-annex popup.

- The command ~magit-annex-list-files~ now supports the ~--allrepos~
  flag through the new popup ~magit-annex-list-popup~.  By default,
  ~@l~ calls ~magit-annex-list-files~ directly, but a prefix argument
  invokes the popup.

- New command ~magit-annex-list-dir-files~ has been added as an action
  in ~magit-annex-list-popup~.  This functionality was previously
  available when a prefix argument was given to
  ~magit-annex-list-files~.

** Interface changes

- The command ~magit-annex-unused-log~ has been replaced by
  ~magit-annex-unused-log-popup~, a command which calls
  ~magit-log-popup~ but sets the ~-S~ flag to the key of the unused
  file at point.  The new option ~magit-annex-unused-stat-argument~
  controls whether the flag ~--stat~ is also added.

- ~magit-annex-unused-sections-hook~ has been removed.

* 1.2.0

** New features

- Commands that prompt for a file have been updated to accept multiple
  files.  The popup for acting on every file as be replaced with an
  entry the multiple-file prompt.

- New option magit-annex-confirm-all-files controls whether or not
  empty input in the file prompt, which means to act on all files, has
  to be confirmed by the user.

  directories are listed in the file prompt.
